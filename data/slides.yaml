- title: Class-conditional Animal Image Generation
  project_page: https://matthewandretaylor.github.io/Generative-Animals
  description: I gathered a small dataset of animal images and trained a diffusion model to generate images of animals.
    I used classifier free guidance to control the class of the generated image. I also tested using auto encoders and changing the architecture to speed up training time.
